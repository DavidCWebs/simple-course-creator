Simple Course Creator
=====================

This WordPress plugin is **still in its development stages** but is functional and safe to use.

Simple Course Creator is designed to easily link posts together in a series and output that series list in the content of each included post.

#### How It Works

Once activated, a new taxonomy is added to your Posts menu called "Courses." Courses are created just like categories and tags.

When creating a new course, it's important to give the course a description as well as a title, which is a new field added by this plugin.

Now with at least one course created, you have the ability to select which course a post belongs to from the edit post screen.

Once a course is selected and saved, a course listing will appear in the content of said post as long as it's not the only post in a course.

The course listing will display as a container that shows nothing but the course title and the course description, which is what you filled out when creating a new course.

The series of posts will be hidden until you click a subtle link for displaying them, at which point the container will gracefully expand to reveal all posts in said course. They will all be linked except for the current post.

Styles are kept to a minimum so theme styles are inherited as much as possible.
